        <h3>TOWARDS A NEW INDIA</h3>
        <p>As a continuing government, we will build on the foundations laid out in the last ve years in terms of reestablishing macro-economic stability, building long-term frameworks of governance, raising India's
            international stature, introducing a non-nonsense approach to internal/external security, upgrading the
            stock of physical/social infrastructure and, most impoantly, building a basic safety net for the deprived
            section of our society. We have demonstrated what all can be achieved by a commied and decisive
            leadership that is not afraid to take hard decisions.<br>
            <br><br>
            In the next ve years, we promise to create growth oppounities for all citizens in every aspect of life. Sab ka
            Saath, Sab ka Vikas remains our guiding principle. We intend to reach out to a developed future while
            retaining our civilisational roots<br><br>
    
            In order to achieve our long-term goals, we must rst secure our country against internal and external
            aggression. These threats need to be dealt with at their roots and our decisive leadership that will equip our
            security apparatus with all the necessary tools. As we have already demonstrated, we intend to use our
            foreign policy, were necessary, in order to tackle the problem of global terrorism. Thus, we intend to
            increase the strength of our diplomatic and allied cadres. We will also build on the “Make in India in Defence”
            initiative to fuher indigenise our defense equipment.<br>
            <br><br>
    
            In the last ve years, we re-imposed macro-economic stability while building lasting frameworks for
            economic governance. These frameworks include the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, ination-targeting,
            nationwide Goods & Services Tax, and the banking sector clean-up. These eos have not only changed
            the business culture of the country and anchored ination at 4 percent, but have also been internationally
            recognized with a sovereign rating upgrade and a sharp rise in our Ease of Doing Business ranking. We will
            ensure that India remains the world's fastest growing major economy 
            in future while maintaining macrostability. We aspire to be the world's third largest economy by 2030.
            <br><br><br>
    
            Since our economic model is based on entrepreneurship and innovation, we commit to simplifying and
            lowing tax rates. An impoant aspect of the ease of doing business is the ability to enforce contracts and
            resolve disputes. Therefore, we promise to signicantly increase the capacity of the legal system within ve
            years in panership/co-ordination with the judiciary.<br>
            <br><br>
    
            The physical infrastructure of the country has undergone an unprecedented upgrade in the last ve years.
            We have connected 91% of villages with rural roads, electried 100% of villages, operationalized 36 new
            airpos and introduced metro networks in several cities. Looking ahead, we plan to build 60,000 km of
            National Highways, connect 100% of villages with rural roads, operationalize 100 new airpos, modernize
            400 railway stations, and cover 50 cities with metro networks.<br>
