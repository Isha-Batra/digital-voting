  <h3 class="H1">TOWARDS A NEW INDIA</h3>
  <p>As a continuing government, we will build on the foundations laid out in the last ve years in terms of
      reestablishing macro-economic stability, building long-term frameworks of governance, raising India's
      international stature, introducing a non-nonsense approach to internal/external security, upgrading the
      stock of physical/social infrastructure and, most impoantly, building a basic safety net for the deprived
      section of our society. We have demonstrated what all can be achieved by a commied and decisive
      leadership that is not afraid to take hard decisions.<br>
      <br>
      In the next ve years, we promise to create growth oppounities for all citizens in every aspect of life. Sab ka
      Saath, Sab ka Vikas remains our guiding principle. We intend to reach out to a developed future while
      retaining our civilisational roots<br>

      In order to achieve our long-term goals, we must rst secure our country against internal and external
      aggression. These threats need to be dealt with at their roots and our decisive leadership that will equip our
      security apparatus with all the necessary tools. As we have already demonstrated, we intend to use our
      foreign policy, were necessary, in order to tackle the problem of global terrorism. Thus, we intend to
      increase the strength of our diplomatic and allied cadres. We will also build on the “Make in India in Defence”
      initiative to fuher indigenise our defense equipment.<br>
      <br>

      In the last ve years, we re-imposed macro-economic stability while building lasting frameworks for
      economic governance. These frameworks include the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code, ination-targeting,
      nationwide Goods & Services Tax, and the banking sector clean-up. These eos have not only changed
      the business culture of the country and anchored ination at 4 percent, but have also been internationally
      recognized with a sovereign rating upgrade and a sharp rise in our Ease of Doing Business ranking. We will
      ensure that India remains the world's fastest growing major economy
      in future while maintaining macrostability. We aspire to be the world's third largest economy by 2030.
      <br><br>

      Since our economic model is based on entrepreneurship and innovation, we commit to simplifying and
      lowing tax rates. An impoant aspect of the ease of doing business is the ability to enforce contracts and
      resolve disputes. Therefore, we promise to signicantly increase the capacity of the legal system within ve
      years in panership/co-ordination with the judiciary.<br>
      <br>
  </p>
  <div class="lastline"></div>


  <p>
      The physical infrastructure of the country has undergone an unprecedented upgrade in the last ve years.
      We have connected 91% of villages with rural roads, electried 100% of villages, operationalized 36 new
      airpos and introduced metro networks in several cities. Looking ahead, we plan to build 60,000 km of
      National Highways, connect 100% of villages with rural roads, operationalize 100 new airpos, modernize
      400 railway stations, and cover 50 cities with metro networks.<br>
      <br>

      Agriculture employs a large propoion of our labour force. In order to ensure remunerative prices for
      farmers, the minimum suppo price for 22 crops was increased to 1.5 times cost of production. In addition,
      we have curbed the large-scale diversion of subsidized farm inputs through measures like Neem-coating
      of urea, rolled out electronic National Agriculture Market (e-NAM), provided insurance cover to 14 crore
      farmers under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana and, most recently, introduced direct income suppo
      for 12 crore farming families through the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi. In the next ve years, we will
      create a National Warehousing Grid, invest Rs25 lakh crores in farm/rural productivity, introduce interestfree
      Kisan Credit Cards and extend the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi to all farmers. We remain
      commied to the promise of doubling farmer incomes by 2022 and more resources will be made available if
      necessary.<br><br>

      In the last ve years, we have created a national common market for the industry and services sectors. By
      lowering ination and cleaning up the banking system, we are now in a position to structurally lower the real
      cost of capital. This is key to a sustained increase in private sector investment. We intend to establish a
      National Traders' Welfare Board as well as announce a National Policy for Retail Trade. The tourism sector will
      be a special focus. We will make sure that all UNESCO World Heritage Sites in India have facilities of
      international standard. We will also identify and promote specic sites of cultural/natural impoance as a
      national priority (while being sensitive to their preservation).<br>
      <br>
      The cultural, ecological and social capital of a country are just as impoant as its economic capital. These
      too need continuous investment and we intend to expand suppo for protecting cultural/linguistic
      heritage, conserving sites of ecological/historical impoance, and promoting our civilizational ideas both
      internationally and to the next generation. We reiterate our stand to explore all possibilities within the
      framework of the Constitution to facilitate the construction of a Ram Temple in Ayodhya.<br>
      <br>
      We remain commied to ensuring the benets of constitutional provisions to the Scheduled Castes,
      Scheduled Tribes and backward classes. We recently introduced a fuher 10% reservation for the
      economically backward sections of the non-reserved category. At the same time, we will expeditiously
      complete the National Registration of Citizens in Assam and actively consider its extension to other states.<br>
      <br>

      Every society progresses through the empowerment of women, inclusion of minorities and the
      encouragement of youth. We will not allow these objectives to be held back by the politics of appeasement.
      Therefore, we hope to modernize personal laws to prohibit practices such as Talaq-e-Biddat and Nikah
      Halala. We intend to invest in our human potential by focusing on the quality of our primary/secondary
      schools as well as expanding our teiary education capacity. In addition, we will also invest in a select set of
      universities and research institutions in order make them world class. <br>
      <br>
      For three generations, India's socio-economic system was held hostage to dynastic perpetuation. This
      propagated a corrupt, self-servicing system of political patronage that came to pervade every aspect of
      life in India. In 2014, the country voted decisively to end this system. Under the leadership of PM Modi, every
      eo has been made to re-establish probity in public life, introduce transparency in policy-making and in
      the management of national assets as well as to bring oenders to book.<br>
      <br>
      The above summary is based on the vision of Prime Minister Modi to build a technologically modern,
      entrepreneurial, rules-based economy that is secure from external/internal security threats and
      simultaneously able to build on its cultural, ecological and social assets.<br>

  <h1 id="NF"  class="H3">Nation First</h1>
  <div class="headlastline"></div>
  <p>The decisive leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi has fundamentally altered the national
      security paradigm of India in the last ve years. Looking ahead, we propose to do the following:
  </p>

  <h2 class="H2">Zero-Tolerance Approach to Terrorism</h2>
  <div class="lastline"></div>
  <p>Our security doctrine will be guided by our national security interest only. This is exemplied by the
      Surgical Strikes and the Air Strikes carried out recently. We will rmly continue our policy of ‘Zero
      Tolerance’ against terrorism and extremism and will continue to follow our policy of giving a free hand
      to our security forces in combating terrorism</p>

  <h2 class="H2">National Security</h2>
  <div class="lastline"></div>
  <p><b>Strengthening our Armed Forces</b> - We will speed up the purchases of outstanding defense related
      equipments and weapons. In order to equip the Armed Forces with modern equipment, we will
      continue to take focused steps to strengthen the strike capability of the Armed Forces.
      <br>
      <b>Self-reliance in defence sector</b> - In order to ensure self-reliance in procurement of defence
      equipment, we have taken several eective steps in the last ve years. For instance, the most modern
      AK-203 automatic ries are being manufactured at Amethi under our 'Make in India in Defence'
      initiative. We are commied to focus on 'Make in India in Defence' to enable indigenous production of
      defence equipment. This will also generate employment and encourage investment in the defence
      sector.
  </p>

  <h2 class="H2">Welfare of Soldiers</h2>
  <div class="lastline"></div>
  <p>We have already demonstrated our commitment to the welfare of our veterans with the
      implementation of long delayed OROP. To take this commitment forward, we promise to create a more
      eective framework for the reselement of our Armed Forces veterans. Under this eo, the Armed
      Forces will sta planning for the reselement of soldiers three years before their retirement and in
      accordance with their preferences. This will include provision for skills training, so skills training,
      nancial suppo for higher education, for housing and for staing an enterprise.
  </p>

  <h2 class="H2">Modernization of Police Forces</h2>
  <div class="lastline"></div>
  <p>We will continue to take forward the process of modernizing the Central Armed Police Forces to
      fuher increase their capacity and readiness and enable them to eectively combat internal security
      challenges.<br>
      We will provide assistance to the states to upgrade their police forces through the ‘Scheme for
      Modernization of Police Forces’. We will encourage expedited police reforms in the states so as to
      enable the State police forces to deal with new types of crimes like cyber crime and help them to be
      more sensitive to the citizens, especially the weak and vulnerable sections of the society
  </p>

  <h2 class="H2">Combating Inltration</h2>
  <div class="lastline"></div>
  <p>There has been a huge change in the cultural and linguistic identity of some areas due to illegal
      immigration, resulting in an adverse impact on local people's livelihood and employment. We will
      expeditiously complete the National Register of Citizens process in these areas on priority. In future we
      will implement the NRC in a phased manner in other pas of the country<br>
      We will continue to undeake eective steps to prevent illegal immigration in the Noheastern states.
      For this, we will fuher strengthen our border security. A pilot project on the use of technology to
      strengthen border security (Sma Fencing) was implemented in Dhubri (Assam). We will implement
      this on all borders.
  </p>

  <h2 class="H2">Reinforcing Border Security</h2>
  <div class="lastline"></div>
  <p>We will focus on creation of developmental and other necessary infrastructure in border areas to
      ensure that border security is strengthened, and to enable increased paicipation of and benets for
      border areas in the country’s development and progress.
      <br>
      We have completed building six integrated check-posts with another under construction to facilitate
      easier trade and travel from the neighboring countries. We will fuher ease the movement of goods
      and people by constructing 14 more integrated check-posts by 2024. Aer completion of all the
      proposed integrated check-posts, all trade movement with Bangladesh, Nepal and Bhutan will be
      conducted through the integrated check-posts
  </p>

  <h2 class="H2">Coastal Safety</h2>
  <div class="lastline"></div>
  <p>Aer eectively strengthening coastal security through implementation of a coastal security scheme
      to provide modern equipment and allocating funds to the states for establishing coastal police
      stations, establishment of National Commiee for Strengthening Maritime & Coastal Security, Island
      Information System and National Academy of Coastal Policing, we will continue to take steps for
      ensuring security of India’s long coastline.</p>

  <h1 id="DF"class="H3">Doubling Farmers’ Income</h1>
  <div class="headlastline"></div>
  <p>At the very beginning of our current term, Prime Minister Modi embarked on a mission to double
      farmers’ income. We will make all eos to achieve this goal by 2022.</p>

  <h2 class="H2">Welfare of Farmers</h2>

      varieties at aordable rates with doorstep testing facilities
  </p>

  <h2 class="H2">Convergence of Agriculture and Technology</h2>
  <div class="lastline"></div>
  <p>We will create a mobile app based system for promoting the availability of agri-implements on
      rental/custom hiring basis.<br>
      We view solar energy as an additional source of income for farmers and will encourage solar farming
      on a massive scale so as to enable the ‘Annadaata’(food provider) to become ‘Urja-daata’ (energy
      provider).<br>
      We will extensively use technology to ensure a beer knowledge of the market prices of various agroproducts for
      the benet of farmers.

  <h2 class="H2">On the Path of Gram Swaraj</h2>
  <div class="lastline"></div>
  <p>Gram Swaraj is one of the principal pillars of Mahatma Gandhi’s vision of India. As we approach the
      150th bih anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Bharatiya Janata Pay resolves to realize his vision of
      Gram Swaraj by ensuring that everyone has equitable access to resources. As India reaches the
      dening milestone of the 75th year of its independence in 2022, we pledge to adopt the ideals of Gram

  <h1 id="IWLE" class="H3">India as the World’s 3rd Largest Economy</h1>
  <div class="headlastline"></div>

  <h2 class="H2">Roadmap for 5 trillion dollar economy</h2>
  <div class="lastline"></div>
  <p>
      India was branded as ‘fragile ve’ in 2014. Within ve years, we have turned India into a bright spot that
      is not only the fastest growing major economy of the world but also enjoys macroeconomic stability.
      We have already become the world’s sixth largest economy and will soon be among the top ve. We
      aspire to make India the third largest economy of the world by 2030. This implies that we commit to
      make India a US $ 5 trillion economy by 2025 and US $ 10 trillion economy by 2032.
      <br>
      When compared to all governments post-1991, this government has delivered the highest rate of
      average GDP growth (7.3%) over the last ve years and maintained lowest rate of average consumer
      ination (4.6%). The consumer ination is presently at 2.6%. This has been achieved with lower scal
      decits and signicantly lower current account decit as a percentage of GDP. Average scal decit
      as a percentage of GDP during 2014-19 has been brought down to 3.7% from 5.4% during 2009-14.
      Reduction in scal decit of this order implies less burden of debt on future generations by almost
      Rs.16 lakh crores. Average Current account decit as a percentage of GDP during this government has
      been reduced to 1.5% from 3.3% during 2009-14.
  </p>

  <h2 class="H2">Tax Policy</h2>
  <div class="lastline"></div>
  <p>Our economic policy has been guided by the principle of lowering the tax rate and improving
      compliance; thereby broadening of the tax base. With improved compliance and increased tax base,
      the tax to GDP ratio has reached 12%, highest in the recent past, up from 10.1% in 2013-14. This
      increased revenue has been deployed for benets to the poor and creation of infrastructure at an
      unprecedented level. We will continue with our policy in the similar manner – lowering of tax rate
      thereby rewarding honest tax payers and improving compliance</p>

  <h2 class="H2">Tax Policy</h2>
  <div class="lastline"></div>
  <p>Goods and Service Tax (GST) has resulted in overall lowering of tax rates and increased revenue
      collection, paicularly for States. When compared to base year of 2015-16, GST revenue for all states
      have increased by 50% in three years. We will continue with the simplication of GST process by
      engaging in dialogue with all stakeholders. </p>

  <h2 class="H2">Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises</h2>
  <div class="lastline"></div>
  <p>A special package was launched by the Government to boost the MSME sector. The Credit Guarantee
      Scheme of the Government of India is an impoant component wherein loans to MSME are
      guaranteed. Under this alone, the credit of around Rs.19,000 crore was achieved in 2017-18. We would
      aim to take this gure to Rs.1,00,000 crore by 2024.
      <br>
      Technology access and upgradation are key elements in the MSME sector. Our government has taken
      a major step in expanding of ‘Technology Centres’ and we would achieve more than 150 such centres
      all over the country by 2024. These Technology Centres would help in mentoring skilling and prototyping of
      MSMEs. They will expose MSMEs to Aicial Intelligence, Robotics, Internet of Things, Viual
      Reality, BlockChain technology and Zero Defect Zero Eect.
      <br>
      The Technology Centres, other skilling centres of MSMEs and NSICs incubation centres alone would
      provide focussed and high level skilling to more than 6 lakh people per year.<br>

  <h2 class="H2">Using Tourism to Cluster Services</h2>
  <div class="lastline"></div>
  <p>Within the services sector, tourism will be special focus because it brings together many dierent
      service segments.<br>
      In paicular, we will identify specic places of cultural or natural impoance in order to develop them
      as comprehensive destinations instead of leaving them as isolated sites. This requires that we look at
      transpo connection, heritage conservation, hotels, restaurants, enteainment and other services in
      an integrated way. We will make an eo to ensure that all these services interconnect. Therefore, the
      government will make sure that schemes/ agencies such as Swachh Bharat, ASI, forest depament
      and local government work together with the travel and hospitality industry. All UNESCO heritage
      sites in India will be upgraded to international level facilities.
      <br>
      The Noh eastern states and our Island/coastal areas will be developed while being sensitive to
      conserving their ecological uniqueness. Similarly, places of cultural impoance will be developed
      while maintaining their unique heritage. As we have recently demonstrated by projects in Varanasi, an
      eo will be made to upgrade these sites while being sensitive to their historical/cultural heritage.
