        Unemployment
        
    </h3>
    <br>
    <p class="p">
        
        Our youth are frustrated due to the sharp fall in employment opportunities during the last few years. Modi had promised creation of 2 crore new jobs annually, i.e., 10 crores by now. Reality is that the unemployment rate rose to the highest levels in 45 years at 6.1 per cent (NSSO). Unemployment rate in February 2019 increased to 7.1 per cent from 5.9 per cent in 2018 (Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy). Situation in rural India is worse. NSSO reports a 3.2 crore job loss of casual labourers from 2011-12 to 2017-18 affecting over 1.5 crore families dependant on incomes from casual labour and agriculture.

        Growing Attacks on SCs and STs
        <br>
        There has been a steady increase in crimes against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, especially in Gujarat and the erstwhile BJP ruled states of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.
        
        Large sections of the adivasis have been deprived of their land pattas due to them under the Forest Rights Act.
        
        An illustration of such increasing attacks is in the state of Gujarat with its much advertised ‘Gujarat Model’, where crimes against SCs and STs increased by 32 per cent and 55 per cent respectively during the last five years (Gujarat Assembly records).
        <br>
        Increasing Violence Against Women
        <br>
        Women have been subjected to increased violence. The year 2016 reported a big increase in crimes against women – four rapes on an average every hour. Since then the Government has stopped publishing statistics by the National Crime Records Bureau in this regard.
        
        The overall dehumanization of our society reflected in growing atrocities against women, particularly the girl child, with gruesome incidents of gangrape and murders of young girls.
        <br>
        Enriching the Rich and Impoverishing the Poor
        <br>
        During these five years the share of the total wealth accruing to the top one per cent of our population increased from 49 per cent in 2014 to 73 per cent in 2018.
        
        Sharp decline in the working conditions for the working class and employees is accompanied by unbearable hike in the price of petroleum products with the government refusing to reduce its taxes and duties.

            Indian Economy Undermined
        </h3>   
    <br>
    <p class="p">

        The lowest growth rate of GDP during these five years ─ from 8.2 per cent in 2013-14 to 7 per cent, in the first three quarters of 2018-19 even according to the motivated data series introduced by this government. According to the earlier data series this stands at mere 4.7 per cent.
        
        In the last quarter GDP growth rate fell further to 6.6 per cent indicating that the economy is sliding into a recession. So much for Modi’s claims of India being the “fastest growing economy” in the world!
        
        GST collections, despite all the tall claims, have shown a steady decline from 7.8 per cent in 2017-18 to 5.8 per cent in 2018-19. This reflects a massive slowdown in the economy.
        
        Demonetisation and GST were a double whammy attack undermining the country’s economic fundamentals. Pre-demonetization Global GDP was 2.6 per cent and grew post demonetization to 3.1 per cent. In contrast, post demonetization  India’s GDP growth fell from 7.8 per cent to 6.8 per cent.
        
        Destruction of people’s livelihood has led to a drastic fall in levels of domestic demand crippling manufacturing and industrial growth. As a consequence, the country’s leading automobile manufacturer, Maruti Suzuki has announced a production cut of 27 per cent citing the fall in demand. The eight core infrastructure industries growth saw a decline of 2.9 per cent between February 2014 and January 2019. The index of Industrial Production (IIP) registered an abysmal low of -0.3 per cent in November 2018 compared to an average growth of 5.7 per cent in the preceding seven months.
        
        Depreciation of the rupee to its historically lowest levels¬ ─ the value of the rupee to a US dollar was 63.19 in 2014. This shot up to 71.76 in 2019.
        
        Drastic fall in India’s export earnings ─ between February 2014 and January 2019 India’s trade balance declined by a whopping 29.8 per cent.
        
        Growing current account deficit i.e. gap between India’s import and export values has been registered in these five years. The Current Account Deficit increased from 1.1 per cent of the GDP in 2017-18 to 2.9 per cent in 2018-19. In dollar terms this translates to a deficit growth from 6.1 billion US dollars to 19.1 billion.
        
        Agricultural growth is at a record low during these years. Agricultural growth rate fell from 5.1 percent to 2.7 per cent and further to 1.7 per cent between February 2015 and February 2019 (CSO). The fourth successive negative growth rate registered in the last four quarters.
